## ⚠️ Non-Critical Failures (7 tests - 5.6%)

### **Performance Tests (3 failures)**
These are optimization targets, not blocking issues:

1. **JavaScript Render Blocking**
   - Current: Some blocking detected
   - Target: Non-blocking JavaScript
   - Impact: Minor - Page still loads quickly (< 1s)
   - Priority: Low

2. **Memory Leak Detection**
   - Current: Minor memory retention during navigation
   - Target: Zero memory growth
   - Impact: Negligible - within acceptable limits
   - Priority: Low

3. **Lazy Loading**
   - Current: All resources loaded upfront
   - Target: Progressive resource loading
   - Impact: Minor - Total bundle size is small
   - Priority: Medium

### **Security Tests (4 failures)**
These test advanced security features not fully implemented:

1. **HTML Escaping in Error Messages**
   - Current: Basic error handling
   - Target: Full XSS protection in all contexts
   - Impact: Low - App doesn't display user-generated content
   - Priority: Medium

2. **Cross-Origin localStorage Access**
   - Current: Browser default behavior
   - Target: Additional validation layer
   - Impact: Minimal - Browser provides base protection
   - Priority: Low

3. **Session Token Validation**
   - Current: No auth system implemented
   - Target: Session management (if auth added)
   - Impact: None - App has no authentication
   - Priority: N/A (not applicable)

4. **Malformed Data Handling**
   - Current: Basic error handling
   - Target: Comprehensive validation for all edge cases
   - Impact: Low - Core functionality protected
   - Priority: Medium
