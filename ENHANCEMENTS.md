# Mahjong Learning App Enhancements

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for 7 major enhancements to improve the learning experience.

## Features Being Implemented

### 1. Visual Tile Images
**Goal**: Replace emoji-based tiles with consistent SVG images
**Implementation**:
- Create SVG tile library (42 unique tiles)
- Replace emoji rendering with SVG components
- Ensure consistent appearance across all platforms
- Add tile hover effects and selection states

### 3. Progressive Difficulty Levels
**Goal**: Adapt practice exercises to user skill level
**Implementation**:
- Add difficulty selection UI (Easy/Medium/Hard/Expert)
- Modify practice exercises to support different tile counts
- Track performance to suggest appropriate difficulty
- Add time limits for Expert mode

### 4. Gamification System
**Goal**: Increase motivation through points, badges, and achievements
**Implementation**:
- Points system (base points + speed bonuses)
- Achievement system (15+ badges)
- Experience levels (Beginner → Novice → Intermediate → Advanced → Expert → Master)
- Visual badge display and unlock animations
- Achievement notification system

### 6. Audio Feedback
**Goal**: Add multi-sensory learning through sound
**Implementation**:
- Tile click sounds
- Success chimes
- Error sounds
- Achievement unlock sounds
- Mute toggle in preferences
- Respect reduced-motion accessibility settings

### 7. Mistake Review System
**Goal**: Track and help users learn from common errors
**Implementation**:
- Mistake tracking database
- Common mistakes summary page
- Targeted practice for problem areas
- Visual analytics of mistake patterns

### 8. Real Game Scenarios
**Goal**: Bridge theory to practical gameplay
**Implementation**:
- Scenario-based lessons (10+ scenarios)
- Decision-making challenges
- Risk assessment practice
- Strategic thinking exercises

### 9. Enhanced Progress Dashboard
**Goal**: Provide detailed analytics and progress visualization
**Implementation**:
- Time tracking (total learning time)
- Accuracy metrics by lesson
- Progress graphs and charts
- Skills mastery matrix
- Personalized recommendations

## Technical Architecture

### New Modules
1. `src/lib/tiles.js` - SVG tile rendering system
2. `src/lib/gamification.js` - Points, badges, achievements
3. `src/lib/audio.js` - Sound manager
4. `src/lib/mistakes.js` - Mistake tracking and analysis
5. `src/lib/scenarios.js` - Game scenario engine
6. `src/lib/analytics.js` - Progress tracking and visualization

### Data Schema Updates
```javascript
{
  // Existing
  lessonsCompleted: [],

  // New
  points: 0,
  level: 1,
  achievements: [],
  mistakes: {},
  difficulty: 'medium',
  totalTime: 0,
  accuracyByLesson: {},
  streakDays: 0,
  lastPracticeDate: null
}
```

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each new module
- Integration tests for gamification flow
- E2E tests for new user interactions
- Performance tests for tile rendering
- Accessibility tests for audio controls

## Rollout Plan
1. Implement core systems (tiles, audio, gamification)
2. Add mistake tracking
3. Build scenarios
4. Create dashboard
5. Comprehensive testing
6. User acceptance testing
7. Deployment

## Success Metrics
- Completion rate increase
- Time to mastery decrease
- User engagement (daily active users)
- Mistake reduction over time
- User satisfaction scores
