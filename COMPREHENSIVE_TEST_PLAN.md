# Comprehensive Testing Plan for Mahjong Learning Application

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Current Test Coverage
- **E2E Tests**: Basic navigation, UI elements, persistence, practice exercises
- **Unit Tests**: DifficultyManager only
- **Missing Coverage**:
  - Most JavaScript modules lack unit tests
  - No integration tests
  - No performance tests
  - No security tests
  - No accessibility tests
  - No cross-browser tests

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] ScenarioEngine
- [ ] TileRenderer
- [ ] MistakeAnalyzer
- [ ] ProgressAnalyzer
- [ ] EnhancedLearningIntegration
- [ ] TutorialManager
- [ ] Preferences
- [ ] Utils
- [ ] Constants and Data

#### 1.2 Integration Testing (Priority: HIGH)
**Framework**: Jest + Testing Library
**Coverage Target**: Core workflows

Workflows to test:
- [ ] Lesson progression flow
- [ ] Practice exercise completion
- [ ] Progress tracking and persistence
- [ ] Difficulty adjustment system
- [ ] Audio system integration
- [ ] Tile rendering pipeline

#### 1.3 System Testing (Priority: HIGH)
**Framework**: Playwright (existing)
**Coverage Target**: All user journeys

Test scenarios:
- [ ] Complete learning path (lesson 1-13)
- [ ] Practice mode completion
- [ ] Settings and preferences
- [ ] Data persistence across sessions
- [ ] Error recovery

#### 1.4 Acceptance Testing (UAT) (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Framework**: Playwright + Manual Testing
**Coverage Target**: Business requirements

Test cases:
- [ ] User can learn Mahjong basics
- [ ] User can practice tile recognition
- [ ] User can track progress
- [ ] User can adjust difficulty
- [ ] User can complete all lessons

#### 1.5 Smoke Testing (Priority: HIGH)
**Framework**: Playwright
**Coverage Target**: Critical paths

Critical functions:
- [ ] Application loads
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Lessons display
- [ ] Practice exercises function
- [ ] Data saves

#### 1.6 Regression Testing (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Framework**: Automated test suite
**Coverage Target**: All existing functionality

Test areas:
- [ ] Previous bugs don't reappear
- [ ] Feature compatibility
- [ ] Data migration
- [ ] API compatibility

### 2. NON-FUNCTIONAL TESTING

#### 2.1 Performance Testing (Priority: HIGH)
**Tools**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest, Custom metrics
**Targets**:
- Page load: < 3 seconds
- Time to Interactive: < 5 seconds
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5 seconds
- Memory usage: < 100MB
- No memory leaks

Tests:
- [ ] Load testing (100+ concurrent users)
- [ ] Stress testing (resource limits)
- [ ] Endurance testing (24-hour session)
- [ ] Volume testing (large datasets)

#### 2.2 Security Testing (Priority: HIGH)
**Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Manual penetration testing
**Coverage**: OWASP Top 10

Tests:
- [ ] XSS vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Local storage security
- [ ] Path traversal protection
- [ ] Content Security Policy
- [ ] Dependency vulnerabilities

#### 2.3 Usability Testing (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Tools**: Manual testing, User feedback
**Metrics**: Task completion rate, Error rate

Tests:
- [ ] Navigation intuitiveness
- [ ] Learning curve
- [ ] Error message clarity
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

#### 2.4 Compatibility Testing (Priority: HIGH)
**Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
**Devices**: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile

Tests:
- [ ] Cross-browser functionality
- [ ] Responsive design
- [ ] Touch interactions
- [ ] Offline functionality
- [ ] Local storage compatibility

#### 2.5 Reliability Testing (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Metrics**: MTBF, MTTR, Availability

Tests:
- [ ] Continuous operation (72 hours)
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Data integrity
- [ ] Graceful degradation

#### 2.6 Recovery Testing (Priority: LOW)
**Scenarios**: Data corruption, Network issues

Tests:
- [ ] Browser crash recovery
- [ ] Data corruption handling
- [ ] Network interruption
- [ ] Storage quota exceeded

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Set up Jest for unit testing
2. Create unit tests for critical modules
3. Enhance existing E2E tests
4. Set up performance monitoring

### Phase 2: Expansion (Week 2)
1. Add integration tests
2. Implement security testing
3. Set up cross-browser testing
4. Create regression test suite

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 3)
1. Performance optimization based on tests
2. Accessibility improvements
3. Usability testing with users
4. Documentation and reporting

## Success Criteria
- Unit test coverage > 80%
- All E2E tests passing
- Performance metrics met
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Cross-browser compatibility verified
- Zero P1 bugs in production

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Test execution time too long
  **Mitigation**: Parallel test execution, test prioritization

- **Risk**: Flaky tests
  **Mitigation**: Retry mechanism, stable test selectors

- **Risk**: Environment differences
  **Mitigation**: Containerized testing, consistent configs

## Deliverables
1. Complete test suite (unit, integration, E2E)
2. Test coverage report
3. Performance benchmark report
4. Security audit report
5. Compatibility matrix
6. Test automation pipeline
7. Bug report with severity classification
8. Recommendations for improvement
