## Testing Date
2025-10-23

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Critical JavaScript Bug
**Location:** `learn-mahjong.html:852-853`

**Issue:** Variable cleared before calculation
```javascript
// BEFORE (Bug):
selectedTiles = [];
correctPairs += selectedTiles.length / 2; // Always adds 0!

// AFTER (Fixed):
const pairsFound = selectedTiles.length / 2;
correctPairs += pairsFound;
selectedTiles = [];
```

**Impact:** High - Practice game couldn't properly track partial progress
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
