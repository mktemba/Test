## 7. CONCLUSION

The Mahjong Learning Application demonstrates solid foundational quality with an 80% pass rate in smoke tests and good security practices. However, critical issues in the practice exercise functionality and unit test coverage need immediate attention.

### Overall Quality Assessment: **B- (Acceptable with Issues)**

**Strengths:**
- Robust navigation and UI components
- Good security implementation
- Responsive design
- Clean architecture

**Weaknesses:**
